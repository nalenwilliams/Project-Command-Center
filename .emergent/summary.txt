The AI engineer successfully expanded the Project Command Center CRM, addressing significant feature requests and critical bug fixes. Key achievements include stabilizing Google OAuth SSO and fixing complex frontend login and onboarding redirection issues for both employees and vendors across multiple iterations. The system now supports direct vendor creation by admins, eliminating the problematic invitation code system, and includes a new vendor profile completion flow with integrated password updates. Extensive work was done to enhance the email notification system, including creating new templates for vendor assignments and resolving a persistent logo display issue through image optimization and base64 embedding. Recurring challenges involved backend routing, database consistency across development environments, and refining frontend UX for onboarding processes. The work culminated in ensuring all essential user flows are functional and branded elements, like email logos, are correctly rendered.

The Project Command Center for Williams Diversified LLC is a multi-user CRM to manage clients, projects, and tasks, with a black/gold theme and role-based access. It integrates Google Workspace (email, calendar, drive), file management, and AI functionality (chat, proposals, command router, form fill using Gemini 2.5 Flash).
Recent expansions included:
1.  **User Profile Enhancement:** Added , .
2.  **Google Workspace Integration:** Google OAuth SSO.
3.  **Communication Hub:** Email composition/sending.
4.  **Payroll Platform:** Node.js/PostgreSQL module for certified payroll, paystubs, employee document portal.
5.  **Vendor Portal:** For invoices, payments, documents, projects, tasks, work orders, schedules, equipment, contracts, safety & compliance.
6.  **Onboarding:** AI-assisted self-onboarding for employees (company email) and vendors. Initially, vendors used invitation codes, but this evolved to direct admin creation, followed by a vendor-completed profile page with password update and document collection (W-4, W-9, COI, NDA).
7.  **Branding:** All forms and email notifications branded with the Williams Diversified LLC logo/theme. Critical feedback on logo display in emails was addressed.
8.  **Notifications:** Event-driven, branded email notifications for employees (paystubs, assignments) and vendors (invoice status, payment, document status, work order/project/task assignments).

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on resolving a persistent issue where the Williams Diversified LLC logo was not displaying correctly in generated email templates. Despite confirming the logo file () was accessible via the web, the user reported it was still not uploaded.
Debugging involved:
1.  Verifying the logo's web accessibility.
2.  Attempting to embed the logo as a base64 data URI to overcome potential email client display issues.
3.  Initially, the base64 URI was too large (280KB), leading to optimization of the  image to a smaller 38KB size.
4.  This optimized logo was then successfully converted to a base64 data URI and embedded into the  file.
5.  All email samples were regenerated using the updated templates.
The last verification step confirmed that the  tag, containing the embedded logo, is now correctly present within the generated HTML email samples, indicating the technical fix for logo display has been implemented.
