The previous AI engineer focused on building out the Project Command Center application, starting from basic MVP features and progressively adding complex functionality. Initial work involved core CRM features, authentication, branding, and setting up the foundational full-stack architecture. A major phase integrated Google Workspace notifications, comprehensive file management with role-based permissions, an AI chat assistant, and eleven new administrative and operational modules. Recent efforts have been heavily concentrated on refining the user experience for file management, particularly within the  component, addressing specific user requests for layout, branding (logo), file upload integration, and making table rows clickable. Concurrently, a significant overhaul for multi-user assignment was implemented, alongside the introduction of a Work Orders module, which required extensive backend model updates for  fields (from string to list) and corresponding frontend UI modifications. Debugging involved resolving Pydantic validation errors for backward compatibility and various frontend rendering issues related to dynamic data display and component layout. The most recent interactions revolve around persistent layout issues for tasks/work orders and ensuring proper data display.

The user required a CRM project management application named Project Command Center for Williams Diversified LLC, featuring an elegant black and gold theme. Key functionalities included multi-user authentication with role-based access (Admin/Manager/Employee), comprehensive management of clients, projects, and tasks, and an administrative dashboard. Specific enhancements requested were Google Workspace email notifications for project/task events, file upload and viewing capabilities with role-based deletion across Projects, Tasks, and Clients. Additional modules were later requested: Employee Handbook/Policies, Fleet Inspection, and eleven more (Invoices, Expenses, Contracts, Equipment, Timesheets, Safety Reports, Certifications, Inventory, Schedules, Reports, Compliance). Role-based visibility was crucial, with employees restricted from Financial Management, Contracts, or Safety & Compliance, while Equipment was visible to all. AI integration (floating chat, module suggestions), direct file uploads within forms, an enhanced full-screen file gallery with project context, dynamic record titles on file buttons, and entire table rows clickable to open the gallery were explicitly requested. The budget field was to be removed from file views. More recently, multi-user assignment for projects and tasks, an Work Orders module with priority (similar to tasks/projects), all assigned users receiving notifications, and precise visual layout adjustments within the  (e.g., logo placement, field order, address display, separation of photos/files) were requested.

<code_architecture>

-   : The core FastAPI application.
    -   **Important**: Contains Pydantic models for Project, Task, and WorkOrder, which were updated to support  as a  and include  and  fields. A  was added for  in these models to handle backward compatibility (converting existing string IDs to lists).
    -   **Changes**: Multi-user assignment logic and notification sending were integrated into project and task creation/update endpoints. The Work Orders API endpoints (create, read, update, delete) were added. Logic for setting  in new records was adjusted to avoid duplicate keyword arguments.
-   : Handles SMTP email sending for notifications.
-   : Manages React routing.
    -   **Changes**: Added routes for the new .
-   : Defines persistent UI and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Updated navigation to include Work Orders as a distinct section. Adjusted navigation rendering logic. Imported  icon.
-   : Reusable file component.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced to accept  prop and pass it to . Modified to always display the record title dynamically on file buttons.
-   : Full-screen gallery view for records.
    -   **Important**: Heavily modified for layout, branding, and functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Added Williams Diversified LLC logo. Integrated Upload Files button at the bottom. Implemented logic to dynamically display record titles. Separated files into Photos and Files sections. Refined record details display (e.g., , , , ). Implemented user fetching and conversion of  IDs to usernames. Added support for  record type in title and details display. Debugged and removed orphaned code causing compilation errors. Adjusted styling for header and details layout. Corrected  check from 'task' to also handle 'tasks' (plural).
-   : **NEW file**. A custom component for selecting multiple users from a dropdown.
-   : Projects management page.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to support  as an array. Integrated  component. Updated  and  to handle array  and include  field in forms. Made table rows clickable to open . Added  field to the project creation/edit form. Passes  prop to .
-   : Tasks management page.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to support  as an array and include  and  fields. Integrated  component. Updated  and  to handle array  and include  in forms. Made table rows clickable. Passes  prop to  and subsequently to . Fixed  scrolling.
-   : **NEW file**. Work Orders management page.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented form for creating/editing work orders, including multi-user assignment using , project linking, and priority selection. Corrected  values to avoid runtime errors (e.g., changed empty string  to ). Added  field to form and / logic. Passes  prop to . Fixed  scrolling.
-   : Axios configuration for API calls.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure consistent layout for Tasks and Work Orders in  to match Projects (fields on the left side, correct order).
- Verify the display of Priority in the Task layout within .
- Investigate and resolve potential caching or deployment issues that prevent recent frontend changes from reflecting in the preview environment.
- Fully populate Assigned to and Assigned by with actual user names (requires first/last names in backend  model, currently only  is available).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging and refining the layout and data display within the  component, particularly for the Tasks and Work Orders modules. Despite several iterations to align the layout (field positioning, inclusion of Priority and Address fields, logo size, file/photo separation) with user feedback, a persistent issue is that the Tasks page layout within the full-screen gallery is not rendering correctly as expected (fields appearing on the right side instead of the left, like Projects). The backend  and  models have been updated to include an  field, and the corresponding frontend forms (, ) have been modified to capture this data. The  component has also been updated to display the  field for tasks and work orders and ensure the  field is present. The most recent action involved reordering task fields in  and restarting the frontend to try and resolve the layout discrepancy, but the preview environment still shows the login screen, indicating a potential deployment or caching issue preventing the latest changes from being fully visible.

<optional_next_step>
I will re-verify the task layout on the deployed preview and investigate potential caching/deployment issues if the layout changes aren't reflecting.
