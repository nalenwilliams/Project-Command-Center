The AI engineer successfully transformed a base application into a highly customized Project Command Center for Williams Diversified LLC. The trajectory began with critical frontend JSX compilation fixes across multiple pages (, , , ). Subsequent work addressed backend login issues, including  version compatibility and database field inconsistencies. Branding was updated as requested. A complex Google Workspace-integrated email notification system was implemented, involving extensive troubleshooting of SMTP settings with the user. Core functionality like file uploads was added to Projects, Tasks, and Clients with granular role-based permissions. The application was then significantly expanded with multiple new modules: Employee Handbook/Policies, Fleet Inspection Reports, and currently, an additional 11 sections for financial management, contracts, inventory, and more. The immediate focus is integrating these newly created pages into the frontend navigation.

The user requested a CRM project management application with multi-user authentication, client/project/task management, and an admin dashboard. The Deals/Sales Pipeline feature was re-specified as Employee Profile. Crucial branding involved customizing for Williams Diversified LLC with a black and elegant gold color scheme, integrating a provided logo, and removing the Made with Emergent badge. Security enhancements included a full admin panel, invitation-based account creation, and role-based permissions (e.g., Employee users have view-only access to clients/projects/employee profiles, and can only update task statuses).

Further requests included:
- Rename CRM Project Management to Project Command Center.
- Implement Google Workspace email notifications for specific events (employee task/project file uploads, new task creation, task status changes, task/project assignments).
- Set up a custom domain: .
- Add comprehensive file upload/view capabilities to Projects, Tasks, and Clients, allowing all users to view/add files, but only Admins/Managers to delete.
- Create new sections for Employee Handbook/Policies and Fleet Inspection Report (all can view/upload, Admins/Managers manage policies).
- Add 11 more sections: Invoices, Expenses, Contracts (Admin/Manager view only), Equipment/Assets, Timesheets, Safety Reports, Certifications, Inventory, Schedules, Reports, and Compliance.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has significantly expanded the application by adding numerous new modules as requested by the user. All backend models and corresponding API endpoints for 11 new sections, including Financial Management (Invoices, Expenses), Contracts, Equipment/Assets, Timesheets, Safety Reports, Certifications, Inventory, Schedules, Reports, and Compliance, have been successfully implemented and integrated into . Additionally, initial frontend page components (, , , , ) have been created, along with placeholder files for the remaining sections. However, these new frontend pages are not yet accessible through the application's UI because their routes in  and navigation links in  have not been fully implemented. The user explicitly pointed out this gap by stating, I don’t see nothing with financials and contracts done I don’t even see a tab for it, which highlights the immediate need to connect these pages to the user interface.
