The AI engineer successfully developed a Project Command Center application for Williams Diversified LLC. Initial work involved frontend JSX fixes, backend login issues (), and branding updates. Key features added were a Google Workspace email notification system, comprehensive file uploads with role-based permissions across Projects, Tasks, and Clients, and the integration of new modules like Employee Handbook, Fleet Inspection, and eleven additional sections (Financials, Contracts, etc.). The agent then focused on integrating these new pages into the frontend navigation, implementing role-based access. AI integration was a major task, involving an  component, a backend AI service using  and , and troubleshooting environment variable loading. The file management system was significantly enhanced from basic uploads to a full-screen gallery (), a rich preview modal () displaying record context, and direct file uploads within creation/edit forms for all relevant sections. Styling issues, specifically cancel button colors, were also addressed. Much interaction revolved around clarifying user expectations, especially regarding deployment environments versus development previews. The final phase involves refining the file display and interaction patterns.

<product_requirements>
The user required a CRM project management app, branded for Williams Diversified LLC with a black and elegant gold scheme. Core features included multi-user authentication with role-based access (Admin/Manager/Employee), client/project/task management, and an admin dashboard. The app was renamed Project Command Center. Specific requests included Google Workspace email notifications for task/project events, a custom domain (), comprehensive file upload/view with role-based deletion for Projects, Tasks, and Clients. Later, new sections for Employee Handbook/Policies, Fleet Inspection, and eleven additional modules (Invoices, Expenses, Contracts, Equipment, Timesheets, Safety Reports, Certifications, Inventory, Schedules, Reports, Compliance) were added. Employees should not see Financial Management, Contracts, or Safety & Compliance. Equipment was made a distinct section, visible to all. Task assignment email notifications, a ChatGPT/AI integration across the app (floating chat, module suggestions), file manager/viewer on all new pages (with a calendar on Schedules), support for all file types (PDFs, notes), direct file uploads in forms, and an enhanced full-screen file gallery with project context were explicitly requested. The budget field was requested to be removed from file views. Finally, the Files button should show the record title, the entire row should be clickable to open the full-screen gallery, and file upload should be integrated directly into the full-screen gallery.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently enhancing the file management experience. Following user feedback, the focus is on making file interactions more intuitive and integrated. Specifically, the engineer is working to allow file uploads directly within the  component, which provides a comprehensive, full-screen view of all attachments for a specific record. This builds upon previous work that introduced  and , which already provide rich contextual details and quick actions for files. The immediate next step is to implement the file upload mechanism inside this full-screen gallery, ensuring users can add new documents or images without returning to the main record editing form. This aligns with the user's explicit request to have file upload capabilities available after opening a record's file section. The plan also includes updating the UI to display the record's title on file buttons and making entire rows clickable to trigger the full-screen gallery.
